Playing around Neowine ALPU-M copy-protection chips

## Background
By truly random luck, I got a bunch of IP Camera e-wastes(cloud platform gone, runs sorts-of-RTOS, NO way for custom firmware). It turns out to have an anti-counterfeiting chip - a 6-pin tiny IC that has some crypto intelligence, interesting! So I took it from the board and tried to have some fun.
